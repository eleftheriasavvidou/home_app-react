# React Home App

This project was developed following the Udemy course [React JS - Mastering Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-mastering-redux/) by David Joseph Katz. In this React application, the user is able to read a random joke, add and delete tasks and read the top stories from the Hacker News.
